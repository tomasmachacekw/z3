PRIO 1
- add invertibility conditions for operators that are currently unhandled (from the unhandled funcion in qe_bv_arith)
- find next important TODO, think about incorporating other operations

PRIO 2
- why normalize = into <= or => when we can replace it and get a more precise aproximation?
-- utilize function from bvspacer to replace x for the first euality, such that we choose the t1,t2 .. t_n st. it has least variables and replace linear occurences
